# Project Constitution

> Auto-generated by GROOT from curriculum configuration.
> This document defines project standards for AI coding assistants.

## Project Overview

- **Curriculum**: Master RAG Implementation with Anthropic Claude
- **Topic**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Anthropic Claude
- **Language**: python
- **Difficulty**: intermediate
- **Target Audience**: Python developers with basic ML/AI knowledge who want to build intelligent document processing and question-answering systems

## Coding Standards

1. Use ONLY the Python standard library — no external dependencies
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
3. Include meaningful comments explaining implementation logic
4. Follow Python-idiomatic naming conventions
5. Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
6. Handle edge cases gracefully

## Test-First Development

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. Tests are provided and define expected behavior
2. Implement source code to make existing tests pass
3. Do NOT modify test files unless explicitly instructed
4. Run tests frequently: `python3 -m pytest -v`

## Implementation Rules

1. **Preserve Existing Structure**: Keep class names, function names, and factory functions exactly as stubbed
2. **No External Dependencies**: No pip install or npm install required; Standard library only; No network calls unless explicitly required by the deliverable
3. **Complete TODO Items**: Implement all TODO comments in source stubs
4. **Educational Code**: Write clear, well-commented code that teaches concepts
5. **Self-Contained Deliverables**: Each deliverable is independent in its own source file

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Python

- Use type hints on all function signatures
- Include docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Import from `src.` package prefix (e.g., `from src.module import Class`)
- Never nest triple-quoted strings (`'''` inside `'''`)

## Phase Guidelines

### Phase 1: RAG Foundations & Document Processing

Plant the seeds of RAG understanding by building your first document processing pipeline and learning how retrieval augments generation

**Key Concepts**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Document Chunking, Context Window, Hallucination

### Phase 2: Semantic Search with Embeddings

Watch your RAG system sprout semantic understanding by implementing embedding-based retrieval for more intelligent document search

**Key Concepts**: Embeddings, Vector Database, Semantic Similarity, Cosine Similarity

### Phase 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering for RAG

Help your RAG sapling grow stronger branches through sophisticated prompt design and context management for Claude

**Key Concepts**: Few-shot Prompting, Chain of Thought, Context Management, Citation Prompting

### Phase 4: Multi-Modal RAG and Advanced Features

Watch your RAG system grow into a strong tree by adding support for images, tables, and complex document structures

**Key Concepts**: Multi-modal RAG, Hybrid Search, Re-ranking, Conversation Memory

### Phase 5: Production RAG Deployment

Let your RAG system flower into a production-ready application with monitoring, optimization, and scalability features

**Key Concepts**: API Rate Limiting, Caching Strategy, Observability, A/B Testing


## Acceptance Criteria Format

Each deliverable has acceptance criteria that define "done":

- Criteria are testable conditions
- All criteria must be satisfied for completion
- Tests verify criteria automatically via `groot check`

## AI Assistant Instructions

When implementing code for this project:

1. Read the spec.md for the deliverable to understand requirements
2. Review plan.md for the suggested implementation approach
3. Follow tasks.md as a step-by-step checklist
4. Run tests after each significant change
5. Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
6. Keep implementations simple and educational
