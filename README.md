## Phase 1: RAG Foundations & Document Processing (Completed)

> Plant the seeds of RAG understanding by building your first document processing pipeline and learning how retrieval augments generation

### Document Ingestion Pipeline

Build a Python script that can load, clean, and chunk various document formats (PDF, TXT, MD)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Successfully processes PDFs, text files, and markdown documents
- [x] Implements intelligent chunking with overlap handling
- [x] Includes error handling for corrupted or unsupported files
- [x] Outputs structured chunks with metadata (source, page number, etc.)

### Basic RAG Question-Answering System

Create a simple RAG system that can answer questions about your processed documents using Claude

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Accepts user questions and searches through document chunks
- [x] Uses basic text similarity for retrieval (TF-IDF or keyword matching)
- [x] Formats retrieved context for Claude API calls
- [x] Returns answers with source citations

## Phase 2: Semantic Search with Embeddings (Completed)

> Watch your RAG system sprout semantic understanding by implementing embedding-based retrieval for more intelligent document search

### Vector Database Implementation

Set up a vector database and implement document embedding storage and retrieval

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Successfully stores document chunks as embeddings in vector database
- [x] Implements efficient similarity search with configurable top-k results
- [x] Includes metadata filtering capabilities
- [x] Provides performance benchmarks for query response times

### Semantic RAG System

Upgrade your RAG system to use semantic search instead of keyword matching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Replaces text-based search with embedding-based similarity search
- [x] Handles query embedding generation and similarity scoring
- [x] Implements retrieval result ranking and filtering
- [x] Demonstrates improved relevance over keyword-based approach

### Retrieval Evaluation Framework

Build a system to evaluate and optimize retrieval quality using test questions and ground truth

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Creates test dataset with questions and expected relevant chunks
- [x] Implements metrics like precision@k, recall@k, and MRR
- [x] Compares different embedding models and chunking strategies
- [x] Generates evaluation reports with actionable insights

## Key Concepts

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

A framework that combines information retrieval with language generation, allowing LLMs to access external knowledge during response generation

### Document Chunking

The process of breaking large documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be effectively processed and retrieved

### Embeddings

Dense vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based search

### Vector Database

A specialized database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (embeddings)

### Retrieval Metrics

- **Precision@k**: Fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant
- **Recall@k**: Fraction of relevant documents that were retrieved
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Average of reciprocal ranks of first relevant result
