# Master RAG Implementation with Anthropic Claude - Phase 1: RAG Foundations & Document Processing

> Plant the seeds of RAG understanding by building your first document processing pipeline and learning how retrieval augments generation

## Growth Stage: Seed

Estimated time: 8 hours

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the core principles of RAG and why it solves LLM limitations
2. Set up development environment with Anthropic API and essential libraries
3. Build a basic document ingestion and chunking pipeline
4. Create your first RAG query using simple text matching

## Deliverables


### Document Ingestion Pipeline

Build a Python script that can load, clean, and chunk various document formats (PDF, TXT, MD)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully processes PDFs, text files, and markdown documents
- [ ] Implements intelligent chunking with overlap handling
- [ ] Includes error handling for corrupted or unsupported files
- [ ] Outputs structured chunks with metadata (source, page number, etc.)


### Basic RAG Question-Answering System

Create a simple RAG system that can answer questions about your processed documents using Claude

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Accepts user questions and searches through document chunks
- [ ] Uses basic text similarity for retrieval (TF-IDF or keyword matching)
- [ ] Formats retrieved context for Claude API calls
- [ ] Returns answers with source citations


## Key Concepts


### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

A framework that combines information retrieval with language generation, allowing LLMs to access external knowledge during response generation


### Document Chunking

The process of breaking large documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be effectively processed and retrieved


### Context Window

The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a language model can process in a single request


### Hallucination

When an LLM generates information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or not supported by the provided context
